# Lab Test 04 (Array)

## Task:

### Question 1
Write a program that:

1. has an **array** with these values:

1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
:---:| :---:| :---:| :---:| :---:| :---:| :---:| :---: |:---: |:---:
14.5| 90.1 |21.8 |34.5 |11.0 |78.3 |30.0 |5.4 |3.1 |67.2

2. Display how many numbers in the array that are in these 3 categories:


...**a.** Less than 20.0
...**b.** between 20.0 and 30.0
...**c.** more than 30.0

3. Prompt the user to enter a **number**. The the program should indicate whether the number they entered is *found* in the **array**, eg. *if* the number is *found* in the array, display the message "**The number you entered is in the array!**", if not found, display the message "**The number you entered is NOT in the array!**".

### Question 2
Write a program that:

1. has an **array** with *FIVE* elements with *integers* data type.

2. Prompt the user to enter *FIVE* **positive** integers into an array, one at a time.

3. Display an error message if the users enters a **negative** integers, and ask them to enter again (continuously ask them until they have enter a positive integer).

4. Display the integers vertically (each integer on a new line).

* **Note**: only display back the integers on the screen AFTER the user have entered FIVE POSITIVE integers.
