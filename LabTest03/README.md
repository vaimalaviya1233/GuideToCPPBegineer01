# Lab Test 01

## Task:

Create ONE program based on steps below:

1. Write a **main function** that prompts that user for their membership status(M = Member, N = Non-Member) and item code (assume only ONE item per transaction). If the user enters an invalid membership status or invalid code, display an error message and ask them to re-enter(continuously ask them until they enter the correct input).

2. The **main function** will then call a **function** named *calculateDiscount* to calculate the total amount to be paid. Function *calculateDiscount* takes in 2 parameters - membership status and item code. Its job is to calculate the new price of item after discount and returns the value to the main function.

3. The main function will then display a receipt which consist of the **membership status**, **item code**, **discount rate**, **riginal price** and **new price**.
