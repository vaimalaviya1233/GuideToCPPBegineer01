# Lab Test 02

## Task:

1. Create a C++ Program that
- uses a **WHILE** structure to prompt and accept a series of payroll
amount for the month of June from the user. The user is allowed to enter
as many payroll amount as they want and they can stop the program
by entering a sentinel amount of -1.
- accumulate the payroll amount so that each time the user enter payroll
amount, the program will add the amount to the total payroll amount.
-print the **total** payroll amount of the screen.

**Output**

2. Every day, a weather station receives temperature expressed in degree Celsius. A program is to be written that will accept each Celcius temperate, The **convert** it to Fahrenheit and display the converted temperature to the screen. After temperature have been processed, the sentence "All temperatures have been processed" is to be displayed on the screenThe formula is as follow:
```
fahrenheit = celcius * 1.8 + 32.0
```   
Create C ++ program using a **FOR** structure, run the loop for 10 times


**Output**

3. Based on Q2, But use a **Do...WHILE** structure prompt the user for the temperatures. User can decide to exit the program by entering -1.


**Output**
